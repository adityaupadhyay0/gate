# Vision
To build the world's most advanced GATE CSE preparation platform, leveraging adaptive AI, industrial-grade algorithms (FSRS v4), and a deterministic ROI-based roadmap to guarantee Rank 1 results for every dedicated aspirant.

# Current Repository State
- **Maturity**: Beta / MVP+
- **Stability**: Stable core functionality; Spaced Repetition (FSRS v4) logic is now robust.

- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, Route Handlers.
- **Database**: SQLite (via Prisma ORM 6.4.1); personalized `fsrsWeights` enabled.
- **AI Systems**: Gemini 1.5 Flash (via `@google/generative-ai`).
- **State Management**: React Server Components + Client-side state for interactive players.
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel-ready; PWA Support enabled.
- **Analytics**: `AnalyticsService` handles mastery, streaks, and weakness detection.
- **Content Pipeline**: Curated JSON/CSV to Prisma seed script.

## ACTIVE TASK

# Task: Rate Limiting for AI Routes

## Priority
High (Cost Control & Security)

## Goal
Implement a robust server-side rate limiting mechanism for AI-powered routes to prevent API credit exhaustion and protect against automated abuse.

## Why It Matters
AI model inference (Gemini 1.5 Flash) incurs costs and has rate limits. Without per-user quotas, a single malicious or runaway client could deplete the system's API credits, disrupting service for all users.

## Scope
- Database schema update to track request counts (`RateLimit` model).
- `RateLimitService` for checking and incrementing quotas.
- Integration into `/api/ai/explain` route.
- Unit tests for the rate limiting logic.

## Dependencies
- Prisma for database persistence.
- Next.js Route Handlers for implementation.

## Implementation Plan
1. Add `RateLimit` model to `prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. Sync database schema using `prisma db push`.
3. Implement `RateLimitService.ts` in `src/lib/services`.
4. Integrate `RateLimitService` into the AI explanation API.
5. Add unit tests for `RateLimitService`.
6. Verify with manual and automated tests.

## UX Improvements
- Clear error messages when rate limits are exceeded (HTTP 429).
- Prevents system-wide downtime due to credit exhaustion.

## Validation Strategy
- Unit tests for window reset logic and count increments.
- Manual verification using multiple rapid requests.

## Risks
- False positives for power users (mitigated by generous daily limits).
- Database overhead for rate limit checks (mitigated by simple indexed lookups).

## Rollback Strategy
- Disable the rate limit check in the API route.

## Completion Criteria
- Requests to `/api/ai/explain` are limited per user (e.g., 20/day).
- Exceeding the limit returns a 429 status with a clear message.
- Logic is verified by tests.
