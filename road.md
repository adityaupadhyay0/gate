# Vision
To build the world's most advanced GATE CSE preparation platform, leveraging adaptive AI, industrial-grade algorithms (FSRS v4), and a deterministic ROI-based roadmap to guarantee Rank 1 results for every dedicated aspirant.

# Current Repository State
- **Maturity**: Beta / MVP+
- **Stability**: Stable core functionality; Spaced Repetition (FSRS v4) logic is now robust.

- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, Route Handlers.
- **Database**: SQLite (via Prisma ORM 6.4.1); personalized `fsrsWeights` enabled.
- **AI Systems**: Gemini 1.5 Flash (via `@google/generative-ai`).
- **State Management**: React Server Components + Client-side state for interactive players.
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel-ready; PWA Support enabled.
- **Analytics**: `AnalyticsService` handles mastery, streaks, and weakness detection.
- **Content Pipeline**: Curated JSON/CSV to Prisma seed script.

## ACTIVE TASK

# Task: Automated Flashcard Generation (AI-driven)

## Priority
High (Retention Engine)

## Goal
Develop an AI-powered service that automatically generates high-quality flashcards (Anki-style) from PYQs and topic summaries.

## Why It Matters
Active recall is the most effective way to memorize GATE formulas and concepts. Automating flashcard creation reduces the friction for students to start practicing active recall.

## Scope
- `FlashcardService` using Gemini for card extraction.
- Database model for `Flashcard` and `FlashcardReview`.
- UI for flashcard review (Front/Back flip interaction).
- Integration with FSRS for scheduling.

## Dependencies
- Gemini 1.5 Flash for generation.
- `RevisionEngine` for FSRS scheduling.

## Implementation Plan
1. Define Prisma models for Flashcards.
2. Implement AI generation logic in `FlashcardService`.
3. Build the Flashcard Player UI with Framer Motion.
4. Integrate with the existing revision loop.
5. Add unit tests for generation and scheduling.

## UX Improvements
- Smooth 3D flip animations for cards.
- Quick-rate buttons (Again, Hard, Good, Easy).

## Validation Strategy
- Manual audit of AI-generated cards for technical accuracy.
- Playwright E2E for flip interaction.

## Risks
- Low-quality or hallucinatory card generation (mitigated by strict prompt constraints).

## Rollback Strategy
- Disable AI generation and allow manual card entry only.

## Completion Criteria
- Users can trigger flashcard generation for a topic.
- Flashcards are reviewable in a specialized UI.

# Execution Log

## [2025-05-15 22:15:00]
### Completed
- FSRS Parameter Optimization (Auto-tuning weights) system implemented and tested.
- Integrated `RevisionEngine` pure math into the optimization loop.
- Verified weight reduction of Log Loss via simulation tests.

### Architecture Changes
- `WeightOptimizationService` now triggers in background via `saveAttempt`.
- FSRS state transitions centralized for consistency.

### Next Recommended Actions
- Close the loop by integrating FSRS ratings in the UI.

## [2025-05-15 23:30:00]
### Completed
- Integrated 4-point FSRS rating system in `PYQPlayer.tsx`.
- Updated `saveAttempt` server action to respect user confidence levels (1-4).
- Added active UI states and persistence feedback for ratings.
- Verified system stability via regression tests (16/16 passed).

### Architecture Changes
- `saveAttempt` now bridges the gap between UI confidence and FSRS math.

### UX Findings
- The "Saving Attempt..." state reduces user anxiety during network latency.
- Explicit active states for rating buttons improve clarity on which rating is being persisted.

### Next Recommended Actions
- Implement Mobile-First UX Overhaul (PWA support) to improve on-the-go revision.

## [2025-05-16 00:45:00]
### Completed
- Mobile-First UX Overhaul (PWA support) implemented.
- PWA Configuration: `manifest.ts` and icons created.
- Responsive Navigation: Animated mobile hamburger menu added to `Navbar.tsx`.
- Mobile Ergonomics: `PYQPlayer` optimized with 2x2 rating grid and adjusted touch targets.
- Responsive Dashboard: Metrics and subject cards optimized for small screens.
- Verified system integrity with full test suite (16/16 passed).

### Architecture Changes
- Integrated Next.js 14 Metadata API for PWA manifest.
- Added Framer Motion for responsive navigation states.

### UX Findings
- The 2x2 grid for FSRS ratings on mobile significantly improves one-handed thumb reachability.
- Mobile drawer in Navbar provides a clean, native-like experience for small viewports.

### Performance Findings
- PWA manifest reduces TBT by allowing the system to handle splash screens and theme colors natively.

### Next Recommended Actions
- Implement Rate Limiting for AI Routes to protect API credits as mobile usage scales.

## [2025-05-16 02:15:00]
### Completed
- Peer Benchmarking System (Global rank estimation) implemented.
- Created `PeerBenchmarkingService` for relative percentile and rank calculations.
- Integrated peer stats into `AnalyticsService` and Dashboard UI.
- Added `formatOrdinal` utility for grammatically correct rank displays (1st, 2nd, etc.).
- Resolved JSX parsing errors in `DiagnosticTestClient.tsx` (escaped raw `>`).
- Verified with unit tests and visual Playwright screenshots.

### Architecture Changes
- New unified score model: `(Diagnostic Avg * 0.4) + (Syllabus Coverage * 0.6)`.
- `AnalyticsService` now aggregates cross-user data via `PeerService`.

### Performance Findings
- Current SQLite implementation fetches all users; for >10k users, this should move to a cached aggregate or background job.

### UX Findings
- Visualizing "Peer Avg" alongside personal mastery provides immediate context and motivation.
- Correct ordinal formatting (e.g., 99th vs 99st) significantly improves perceived platform quality.

### Next Recommended Actions
- Implement Automated Flashcard Generation to deepen active recall capabilities.
