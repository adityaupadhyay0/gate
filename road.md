## ACTIVE TASK

# Task: Peer Benchmarking System (Global rank estimation)

## Priority
Medium (Motivation & Social Proof)

## Goal
Implement a global benchmarking engine that estimates a user's potential GATE rank by comparing their mastery and FSRS stability against the wider population.

## Why It Matters
Rank estimation is the #1 requested feature for GATE aspirants. It provides tangible progress metrics and creates a healthy competitive environment.

## Scope
- Aggregation engine for global mastery averages.
- Percentile calculation logic.
- Rank estimation formula (Mastery * Weight + Speed * Weight).
- Global Leaderboard UI.

## Dependencies
- AnalyticsService for individual data.
- Aggregation queries for global stats.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `GlobalAnalyticsService` for cross-user data.
2. Implement rank estimation algorithm in `TestEngine`.
3. Build Leaderboard component.
4. Add "Global Percentile" metrics to Dashboard.

## UX Improvements
- Real-time rank updates after tests.
- Visual percentile curves.

## Validation Strategy
- Simulation with 1000+ mock attempts.

## Risks
- Data privacy (anonymized stats only).

## Rollback Strategy
- Disable leaderboard feature flag.

## Completion Criteria
- User sees "Estimated Global Rank" on Dashboard.
- Leaderboard shows top 100 aspirants anonymized.

## [2025-05-16 02:00:00]
### Completed
- AI Rate Limiting: Implemented a 20-request/24-hour limit per user for the `/api/ai/explain` route.
- Database: Added `RateLimit` model to Prisma schema with unique constraints and cascade deletion.
- Service: Created `RateLimitService.ts` with atomic-like fixed-window reset logic.
- API: Integrated headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`) and 429 status code handling.
- UI: Enhanced `PYQPlayer.tsx` with a dedicated "Limit Reached" error state and policy enforcement messaging.
- Fixed JSX parsing error in `DiagnosticTestClient.tsx` (escaped `>` in text).
- Verified implementation with unit tests (3/3 passed) and visual Playwright verification.

### Architecture Changes
- Centralized usage tracking in `RateLimitService`.
- standardizing API error responses with machine-readable `code` fields.

### UX Findings
- The "Limit Reached" UI block with a clear call-to-action (Upgrade to Pro) provides a path forward for users instead of a dead end.
- Policy enforcement messaging (Gemini 1.5 Pro Analysis vs Policy Enforcement) maintains a high-quality brand voice even during errors.

### Next Recommended Actions
- Implement Peer Benchmarking System (Global rank estimation) to increase competitive engagement.
