## ACTIVE TASK

# Task: Rate Limiting for AI Routes

## Priority
High (Cost Control & Security)

## Goal
Implement a robust rate-limiting system for AI-powered features (like 'AI Explain') to prevent API credit exhaustion and ensure fair usage across all users.

## Why It Matters
AI requests (Gemini API) incur costs. As the platform scales, unauthorized or excessive usage could drain resources. Rate limiting protects the infrastructure and maintains service availability.

## Scope
- Prisma schema update for `RateLimit` tracking.
- `RateLimitService` for window-based usage tracking.
- Integration into `/api/ai/explain` and other AI routes.
- Frontend UI handling for 429 (Too Many Requests) states.

## Dependencies
- Prisma ORM.
- `date-fns` for precise window calculations.

## Implementation Plan
1. Define `RateLimit` model in `schema.prisma`.
2. Implement `RateLimitService` with 24-hour window logic.
3. Apply rate limits to `src/app/api/ai/explain/route.ts`.
4. Update `PYQPlayer.tsx` to handle and display rate limit errors.
5. Verify with unit tests and manual mock triggers.

## UX Improvements
- Clear communication when limits are reached.
- Precise countdowns for limit resets (optional but recommended).

## Validation Strategy
- Unit tests for `RateLimitService`.
- Manual verification by mocking 429 responses.

## Risks
- Over-aggressive blocking of legitimate users.

## Rollback Strategy
- Disable rate-limit middleware/checks in the API route.

## Completion Criteria
- AI routes return 429 after exceeding 20 requests/24h (configurable).
- Frontend displays a non-intrusive but clear 'Limit Reached' message.
- Usage is persisted correctly in the database.
