## ACTIVE TASK

# Task: Mobile-First UX Overhaul (PWA support)

## Priority
High (Accessibility & Retention)

## Goal
Transform the platform into a production-grade Progressive Web App (PWA) with a mobile-first UI, ensuring seamless learning on the go.

## Why It Matters
A large portion of GATE aspirants study during commutes or in short breaks. PWA support and mobile optimization are critical for maintaining high retention and providing a native-like experience without the friction of app stores.

## Scope
- PWA Configuration (`manifest.ts`, icons).
- Responsive Navigation (Mobile hamburger menu).
- Mobile-optimized `PYQPlayer` (Touch-friendly targets, 2x2 rating grid).
- Responsive Dashboard layout adjustments.

## Dependencies
- Framer Motion for mobile animations.
- Next.js Metadata API for PWA.

## Implementation Plan
1. Configure PWA manifest and assets.
2. Implement mobile-responsive Navbar with animated drawer.
3. Refactor `PYQPlayer` for better mobile ergonomics.
4. Optimize Dashboard grid and spacing for small screens.
5. Verify across responsive breakpoints.

## UX Improvements
- Smooth mobile transitions.
- High-contrast touch targets.
- Minimalist mobile navigation.

## Validation Strategy
- Audit via Chrome DevTools (Lighthouse PWA).
- Manual breakpoint testing.

## Risks
- Complex layout regressions on desktop.

## Rollback Strategy
- Revert to standard responsive Tailwind classes.

## Completion Criteria
- Platform is installable as a PWA.
- All core flows (Roadmap, Player, Dashboard) are fully functional and aesthetic on mobile (375px+).
