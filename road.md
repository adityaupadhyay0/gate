## ACTIVE TASK

# Task: Rate Limiting for AI Routes

## Priority
Critical (Cost Control & Security)

## Goal
Implement a robust rate-limiting system for AI-powered features (like technical derivations and doubt solving) to prevent API credit exhaustion and potential abuse.

## Why It Matters
As the user base grows, unprotected AI endpoints represent a significant financial and security risk. Implementing per-user rate limits ensures sustainable scaling and protects the platform's core AI capabilities from being drained by bot traffic or excessive individual usage.

## Scope
- New Prisma model `RateLimit` for tracking usage.
- `RateLimitService` for managing limit checks and resets.
- Integration into `/api/ai/explain` route.
- User-facing "Limit Reached" UI states in `PYQPlayer`.

## Dependencies
- Prisma (Database persistence).
- Auth.js (User identification).

## Implementation Plan
1. Define `RateLimit` model in schema.
2. Implement `RateLimitService` with window-based tracking (20 requests/24h).
3. Secure the `/api/ai/explain` route with the new service.
4. Add error handling and "Limit Reached" UI to `PYQPlayer`.
5. Verify via unit and integration tests.

## UX Improvements
- Clear communication when limits are hit.
- Predictive "remaining" counters (optional/future).

## Validation Strategy
- Unit tests for `RateLimitService` logic.
- Integration tests for the AI route.
- Manual verification of the 429 response handling.

## Risks
- Incorrect reset timing causing user frustration.
- Race conditions in high-concurrency usage (mitigated by Prisma atomic updates).

## Rollback Strategy
- Disable the middleware check in the AI route handler.

## Completion Criteria
- AI routes return 429 after exceeding 20 requests in a 24h window.
- UI gracefully displays the limit message.
- Usage is correctly persisted and reset.
