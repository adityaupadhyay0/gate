# Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS (Premium UI), Framer Motion (Animations), Lucide React (Icons).
- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, Route Handlers.
- **Database**: SQLite (via Prisma ORM 6.4.1); personalized `fsrsWeights` enabled.
- **AI Systems**: Gemini 1.5 Flash (via `@google/generative-ai`).
- **State Management**: React Server Components + Client-side state for interactive players.
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel-ready; PWA Support enabled.
- **Analytics**: `AnalyticsService` handles mastery, streaks, and weakness detection.
- **Content Pipeline**: Curated JSON/CSV to Prisma seed script.

## ACTIVE TASK

# Task: Peer Benchmarking System (Global rank estimation)

## Priority
High (Competitive motivation & Accuracy)

## Goal
Implement a real-time global benchmarking system that estimates a user's rank and percentile relative to the entire platform's user base.

## Why It Matters
GATE is a highly competitive exam. Knowing where one stands in the global distribution is a powerful motivator and provides a more realistic assessment than isolated mastery scores.

## Scope
- `PeerBenchmarkingService` for rank calculation.
- Scoring formula: `(Diagnostic Average * 0.4) + (Syllabus Coverage * 0.6)`.
- Integration with `AnalyticsService` for real-time updates.
- Dashboard UI enhancements to display percentile and global rank.

## Dependencies
- `AnalyticsService` for mastery and diagnostic data.
- Prisma for cross-user data aggregation.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `PeerBenchmarkingService.ts` with global ranking logic.
2. Integrate ranking into `AnalyticsService.getOverallStats`.
3. Update Dashboard to display "Global Percentile".
4. Add unit tests for ranking accuracy.

## UX Improvements
- High-impact percentile badge on Dashboard.
- Smooth number animations for rank updates.

## Validation Strategy
- Unit tests with mock user distributions.
- E2E verification of Dashboard rendering.

## Risks
- Performance impact of platform-wide rank calculation as user base grows (mitigated by indexing and potential caching).

## Rollback Strategy
- Revert to static heuristic-based rank estimation.

## Completion Criteria
- Rank is calculated dynamically based on real peer data.
- Percentile is displayed on the Dashboard.
- Calculation logic is verified by tests.
